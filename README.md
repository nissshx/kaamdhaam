The KaamDhaam project is a web-based Kanban board application designed to streamline task management for individual users. Developed using React and Next.js, the application offers a user-friendly interface with features that include project creation, task categorization, and seamless task movement across different stages of development (Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done). Data persistence is ensured through the use of the browser's local storage, enabling users to retain their task data across sessions. The application aims to enhance productivity by providing a clear visual representation of tasks, thus aiding in efficient project tracking and management. Feedback from users has been positive, highlighting the application's ease of use and visual appeal. The project identifies future enhancements such as collaboration features, detailed analytics, and mobile optimization. While currently limited to single-user mode, KaamDhaam successfully demonstrates the potential of simple, yet effective, digital tools in personal task management
